                    <h3>Will my wall look exactly like the photos?</h3>
                    <p>No. Mineral and decorative finishes are hand-applied materials. While reference images guide tone
                        and texture, each wall reacts differently to light, substrate, and application. Variation is
                        inherent and intentional.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are uneven tones or marks considered defects?</h3>
                    <p>No. Movement, tonal shifts, and visible strokes are part of the character of mineral finishes
                        and are not classified as defects.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I request a perfectly uniform finish?</h3>
                    <p>Mineral finishes are not suitable for clients expecting flat, uniform colour. If uniformity is a
                        priority, we will recommend alternative systems.</p>

                    <h3>Do you use specific brands (e.g. Novacolor, etc.)?</h3>
                    <p>We work with multiple mineral and decorative systems. Materials are specified based on surface
                        condition, environment, and desired outcome rather than brand preference.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I choose the exact material beforehand?</h3>
                    <p>Final material selection is confirmed after surface evaluation to ensure compatibility and
                        durability.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are these finishes eco-friendly?</h3>
                    <p>Most mineral systems are breathable and low-VOC. Suitability depends on application area and
                        substrate.</p>

                    <p>We do not provide 'standard' or budget painting. We execute <strong>Architectural Paint
                            Systems</strong>. This includes moisture assessment, substrate-specific priming, and
                        multi-layer execution. If you are seeking a 'cheap lick of paint' without technical oversight,
                        our services are not a match.</p>

                    <h3>Lime Paint: Will the colour be 100% solid?</h3>
                    <p>No. Lime paint is a mineral finish that creates 'clouding' or tonal movement. If you want a
                        perfectly flat, plastic-look solid colour, you should choose a standard acrylic paint (which we
                        do not prioritize).</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Lime Plaster: Are the texture marks flaws?</h3>
                    <p>No. Hand-applied plaster marks are the intentional signature of the artisan. We do not provide
                        'machine-smooth' mineral plaster. If you desire zero texture, this system is not for you.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Microcement: Is it indestructible?</h3>
                    <p>No. While highly durable, microcement can crack if the building structure moves or if heavy
                        objects are dropped. It is a premium skin, not a structural reinforcement.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Liquid Metal: Why is the colour changing?</h3>
                    <p>Liquid metal contains real metal particles that <strong>will oxidise and patina</strong> over
                        time. This is a natural reaction to the environment and is considered a feature, not a defect.
                    </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Patina & Oxidised: Can you control the exact rust pattern?</h3>
                    <p>No. Reactive finishes are inherently unpredictable. We guide the direction, but the final pattern
                        is a result of material behaviour. No two walls will ever be the same.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Industrial Epoxy: Will it look like a decorative floor?</h3>
                    <p>Our industrial systems prioritize <strong>function over decoration</strong>. While they look
                        clean and professional, they are specified for chemical and abrasion resistance, not as a
                        decorative 'showroom' finish.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Waterproofing: Does it fix existing structural leaks?</h3>
                    <p>No. Waterproofing systems prevent surface penetration; they do not fix cracked pipes or
                        structural slab failures. Structural issues must be resolved by a specialist before our
                        application.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Custom Murals: Can I change the design on-site?</h3>
                    <p>No. Designs are locked in during the mock-up phase. Any on-site changes to approved graphics will
                        halt production and be fully chargeable as a new project scope.</p>

                    <p>Mineral and decorative surface systems are bespoke, hand-applied works. Once the application
                        process
                        begins (surface preparation or material mixing), the project is <strong>strictly
                            non-refundable</strong>. Cancellations after material procurement but before application

                        window frames, rising damp from slabs, or leaking pipes discovered after our initial assessment.
                        Surface systems are finishes, not structural waterproofing repairs.</p>

                    <p>Texture and tonal movement are agreed upon during the sampling/mock-up phase. If the client
                        requests a change after application has started, this is classified as a change in scope and
                        will be <strong>fully chargeable</strong> at current rates.</p>

                    <p>Yes, when specified and applied correctly. Lime-based finishes are naturally breathable and allow
                        moisture to pass through rather than trap it behind the wall.</p>

                    <h3>Will humidity cause mould or peeling?</h3>
                    <p>Breathable finishes reduce the risk of trapped moisture, but no wall finish can compensate for
                        ongoing water ingress, leaks, or persistently damp substrates. Surface condition and environment
                        must be assessed before application.</p>

                    <h3>Should air-conditioning be turned off during application?</h3>
                    <p>We may recommend limiting air-conditioning during application and initial curing to allow the
                        finish to set evenly. Specific guidance will be provided per project.</p>

                    <h3>Will air-conditioning damage the finish long term?</h3>
                    <p>Once fully cured, mineral finishes perform well in air-conditioned spaces. However, extreme
                        temperature cycling may accentuate natural tonal variation over time.</p>

                Sealers</h3>

                    <h3>Do mineral finishes require a sealer?</h3>
                    <p>Some systems may require sealing depending on location, usage, and exposure. Sealers are
                        specified only when necessary to balance protection and breathability.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will sealing change the appearance of the finish?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Sealers may slightly deepen colour, reduce porosity, or alter sheen. This is considered part
                        of the finish specification, not a defect.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I choose not to use a sealer?</h3>
                    <p>In certain applications, an unsealed finish may be acceptable. However, omitting a recommended
                        sealer may affect durability and maintenance expectations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are sealed mineral finishes waterproof?</h3>
                    <p>Sealers provide resistance, not complete waterproofing. Mineral finishes are not intended to
                        replace waterproofing systems.</p>
